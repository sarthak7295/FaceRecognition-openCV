# FaceRecognition-openCV
FacialRecognition software using python and open cv

so i started looking for a code for facial recoginition using python and i found one wich was dam easy .
is simply used a opencv library to recognise face -_- ....well that is not intresting . (PS: file is test.py simply run it and done)

So I wanted to build a facial recognition from scratch. So lets get to it!!

but first lets get our basics right from https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html

These would be put in file <b>basics.py</b>
