# FaceRecognition-openCV
FacialRecognition software using python and open cv

so i started looking for a code for facial recoginition using python and i found one wich was dam easy .
is simply used a opencv library to recognise face -_- ....well that is not intresting . (PS: file is test.py simply run it and done)

So I wanted to build a facial recognition from scratch. So lets get to it!!

but first lets get our basics right from https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html

These would be put in file <b>basics.py</b>  Do not rujn this py file without commenting other sections 

So now what i found out that the file <b>test.py</b> uses a classifier called harr cascade to detect faces in an image

which is like you give image to python it uses harrcascade classifier as kind of a filter to figure out where faces are like convolutional neural nets...
well these file can be found over the internet. 

I would now attempt to build my own harr casscade in this repo

would be creating a different repo to recognise faces using tensorflow using convoluted NN and compare them both.

Setps for creating your own haar_cascade.xml ...do read about haar cascade it is an intesting topic https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html#face-detection
